      <p>
        My research focuses on communication systems, information theory, and
        secure internetworked infrastructures. I am particularly interested in
        the intersection of performance, security, and scalability in modern
        networks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Current work explores adaptive routing, congestion control, and the
        application of machine learning techniques to optimize network
        resilience under adversarial conditions.
